# Sorting_visualizer
-By Aashish Kumar Jha

Sorting an array means to arrange the elements in the array in a certain order. Various algorithms have been designed that sort the array using different methods. Some of these sorts are more useful than the others in certain situations.

Here We are sorting the arrays in Ascending  Order.

I have added four different sorting algorithms to display their working,They are as follows:-

1.Bubble Sort

2.Insertion Sort

3.Merge Sort

4.Quick Sort

They have different principles and time and space complexities also varies.
